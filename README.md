# Wallet Manager

This project consists of a Solidity smart contract for managing a simple wallet and a React frontend to interact with it. The smart contract allows users to create a wallet, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and transfer funds to other accounts. The React frontend connects to the Ethereum blockchain using MetaMask and allows users to interact with the smart contract.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MetaMask browser extension
- An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
